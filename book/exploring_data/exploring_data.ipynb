For example, in the histogram above we can tell that the bin with the greatest frequency of values was $[60, 70)$ since that bar is the highest, whereas no data fell in the bin $[90, 100)$, so that bar doesn't show up at all! By imagining where the center of mass of the shape would be (if you tried to balance the shape on your finger, where along the bottom edge would you place it?) then we can get an idea where the mean of the data set is. By looking at the extremes of our histogram we know that our temperature data is never greater than 90, and never less than 0. But, since the bars at the extremes are short, we know that most of the temperatures are actually between 20 and 80 degrees. And, we can notice that the mass of the histogram is more bunched up towards the higher values than the lower values, so it's more likely for us to see a high value within our possible range than to see a low value."
