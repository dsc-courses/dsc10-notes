Dive Into Data Science
======================

**by Parker Addison and Justin Eldridge**

Welcome to *Dive into Data Science*. In this book, we'll learn the tools and techniques used by actual data scientists without assuming any prior knowledge of programming or statistics.

This is the textbook for [DSC 10](http://www.dsc10.com) at UC San Diego.

*Dive into Data Science* is based on *Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science* by Ani Adhikari, John DeNero, and David Wagner.
