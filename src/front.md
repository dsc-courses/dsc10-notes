DSC 10 Course Notes
===================

Welcome to the [DSC 10](http://dsc10.com) course notes.

DSC 10 is an introductory data science course which develops the core ideas of
statistics via programming and simulation instead of the manipulation of
mathematical formulae. At the same time, the course does not assume that the
reader has any experience in programming; instead, we learn "just enough"
programming to do data science. 

DSC 10 is based on Berkeley's [Data 8](http://data8.org/). Likewise, these
course notes are based on the textbook used in Data 8 &mdash; [*Computational and
Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data
Science*](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) by Ani Adhikari,
John DeNero, and David Wagner. Whereas Data 8 and *Computational and Inferential
Thinking* introduce programming with tabular data using the
[`datascience`](https://github.com/data-8/datascience) module, DSC 10 and these
course notes instead use
[`babypandas`](https://github.com/babypandas-dev/babypandas). `babypandas` is an
opinionated subset of the popular `pandas` package designed with the
novice data scientist in mind.
