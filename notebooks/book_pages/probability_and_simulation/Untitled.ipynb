Given the proper data set, we could answer a question like \"*how many people between the age of 30-40 have diabetes?*\". However, many of the decisions we face in life arise from questions that don't have such clear-cut answers, like \"*a 35 year old patient just walked into the doctors office, do they have diabetes?*\". The outcome of this question is subject to uncertainty -- we can't be sure of the truth until it's been observed.\n",

    "Let's entertain an example that we should all be familiar with: flipping a coin. Unbeknownst to most, flipping a coin is an incredibly complex process whose outcome depends on a nigh infinite number of factors: the starting orientation of the coin, the strength with which it's flipped, the presence of a breeze, the wear and tear of the coin... et cetera... all culminating with whether or not the catcher chooses to keep the coin resting in their palm or slap it on to the back of their other hand after they catch it! But in practice, we don't think about a coin flip this way. Not only is it infeasible to attempt to calculate all of those factors (lest even name them all!), but we can nicely summarize the coin flipping process with a simple {dterm}`probabilitistic model`: we expect that half of the time the coin will show Heads, and half of the time it will show Tails.\n",

    "In life we call processes like flipping a coin *random*, with outcomes that are subject to *chance*. Any time you hear these words, understand that a probabilistic model is at play, and therefore any questions about this process must be answered by working with the likelihood (probabilities) of each outcome using that model."
