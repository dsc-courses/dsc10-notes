    "Invariably, there is random chance involved during sampling, so in most cases we won't produce a sample distribution that is exactly the same as the population. Each sample looks a bit different from the population and from each other, but greater disparities have rarer probabilities. It's downright statistically *unlikely* that we could produce a large sample distribution that looks super different from our population distribution."
