This directory contains machine-generated versions of the Jupyter notebooks
used as textbook pages, but with ugly directive cells removed. Removing
directive cells can be performed by running `make notebooks` in the project
root. This target is also run whenever the HTML version of the textbook is built
(using `make html`).
